## Track Segmentation

Song files are split into multiple segments, which the game engine pieces back together. This allows DJ Professor K's track transitions to function smoothly.

### Demo

Here's an example of JSR's track segmentation in effect using **Super Brothers** by *Guitar Vader*:

#### **1. Intro Segment**
The first part of the intro is stored separately. In JSR, the full intro is typically only heard when the level starts with this song.
<ReactAudioPlayer src="https://github.com/Loomeh/jsr-re-wiki/raw/refs/heads/main/audio/SUPER_F1.OGG" controls />  

#### **2. First Verse**
For other songs transitioning into this one, this is the file the transition cuts to.
<ReactAudioPlayer src="https://github.com/Loomeh/jsr-re-wiki/raw/refs/heads/main/audio/SUPER_F2.OGG" controls />  

#### **3. Mid-Song Segment**
The next part of the song plays up until the bridge.
<ReactAudioPlayer src="https://github.com/Loomeh/jsr-re-wiki/raw/refs/heads/main/audio/SUPER_M1.OGG" controls />  

#### **4. Bridge**
<ReactAudioPlayer src="https://github.com/Loomeh/jsr-re-wiki/raw/refs/heads/main/audio/SUPER_M2.OGG" controls />  

#### **5. Final Segment**
<ReactAudioPlayer src="https://github.com/Loomeh/jsr-re-wiki/raw/refs/heads/main/audio/SUPER_M3.OGG" controls />  

#### **6. Loop or Transition**
- **If the song loops**, it loads this file:
  <ReactAudioPlayer src="https://github.com/Loomeh/jsr-re-wiki/raw/refs/heads/main/audio/SUPER_R.OGG" controls />  

- **If transitioning to another song**, it loads the transition file for that song:
  <ReactAudioPlayer src="https://github.com/Loomeh/jsr-re-wiki/raw/refs/heads/main/audio/SUP_ROC1.OGG" controls />

## File Formatting

### **Dreamcast Version**
> *Insert details about the Dreamcast audio files here.*

### **HD Version**
In *Jet Set Radio HD*, music files are stored in the **Opus** (`.ogg`) format. Players can replace in-game tracks by placing custom `.ogg` files named identically to the archived ones inside the `CUSTOM` directory.

This feature appears to be an **unintended oversight** by Blit.
