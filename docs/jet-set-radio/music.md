# Music

### File Locations
- **Directory:** `JETRADIO/CUSTOM/`
- **File Extensions:** `.ARC`, `.ogg`

In both versions of *Jet Set Radio*, the game's music files are stored in ARC archive files.

## Track Segmentation
Song files are split into multiple segments, which the game engine pieces back together. This allows DJ Professor K's track transitions to function smoothly.

## File Formatting

### Dreamcast Version
> *Insert details about the Dreamcast audio files here.*

### HD Version
In *Jet Set Radio HD*, music files are stored in the **Opus** (`.ogg`) format. Players can replace in-game tracks by placing custom `.ogg` files named identically to the archived ones inside the `CUSTOM` directory.  
This feature appears to be an **unintended oversight** by Blit.
