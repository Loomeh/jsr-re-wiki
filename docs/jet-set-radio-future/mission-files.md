# Mission Files

### File Locations
- **Directory:** `Media/Mission/`
- **File Extensions:** `.bin`

## Description

Mission files are the way JSRF defines objectives (and their logic) for each level and chapter. In development, they were built using a custom scripting language.

Mission files dictate things such as:
- Player character and camera spawn locations
- Exit zones
- Graffiti locations
- Objectives
- Objective logic
- Event triggers
- Cop fight zones
- Boss fights

## Binary Analysis
:::note
An actual binary analysis is still being written up. For now, this video by Code Not Magic provides a good analysis of a mission files' binary structure.
